# A tiny turtle graphics app

it watches main.turtle script file and re-interprets it on its modification

the only commands available are: 
-	move 10	 -> moves 10 pixels forward
-	turn -90	 -> rotates turtle by 90 degrees
-	repeat 5	 -> repeats everything on the same level of indentation _before_ the repeat command 5 times
